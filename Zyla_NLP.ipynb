But it's total nuisance and fraud and quality is not upto the mark. Customer management is total useless. Am sure the positive feedback which we see is purchased ones. Not at all suitable for 4.7 rating.   \n",

All topics are usefull. I go through this app for my wife. It's useful. But as a working person to monitor all details (vitals) everyday is difficult, but I also agree it's require to monitor health condition by dr. So We together needs to be find out midway to capture all vitals atleast on regular interval. Thanks...   \n",

We could treat our son at home itself even when his fever was 104 plus. We were relieved from our doubts and fears which made us to respond to the situation properly. The most interesting part is they give remedial medicines which are almost available in our kitchen. Time to time different professionals monitored. Thanks Zyla. All the best   \n",

The diabetic was not controlled even after consulting many doctors and I was not too regular to doctors. Somehow I got to know this ZYLA app, first I was not sure that how doctors will treat online? To my surprise, after two months treatment my sugar levels are coming down with the assistance of care team. They are in regular contact with the app and telephone calls. They clear all your doubts over the app only, the thing is one should not hesitate to ask them.   \n",

Tried so many apps before but found Zyla as the most appropriate. Here at Zyla you've got everything that can work to bring down the sugar level,reducing weight,recipes and best of all Zyla as your sober companion. I am confident that a difference will be made in the next two months in achieving my long term goals. Thankyou Zyla😀   \n",

Cannot count calories/macronutrients. The worst part is I requested a callback. They called me to explainthe package. I said I am interested and asked a few questions for which I haven't got any response or answer from them yet. As a customer, I am chasing them to reply me. they don't want to get hold of a potential customer who is ready to pay them. A very disappointing approach from them and how to trust them???   \n",

It's like meeting a doctor every day. Which is not possible in day today life. So all your doubts get clear. The physical activity and diet as per the person can change. So it's a personal treatment more than generalized. Also I feel when the sugar levels are more we follow up about diet, exercise and testing very rigerously. But as days pass we start finding a reason for not continuing. I think this app always remind us. So we do all.   \n",
