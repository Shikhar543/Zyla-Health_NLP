Welcome to this NLP Project for Zyla Health Company . I have scraped the necessary details like reviews, ratings etc. from Google Play Store and performed Data Cleaning , Data Processing and essential Natural Language 
Processing methods such as Topic Modeling to remove unnecessary emojis and punctuations and whitespaces, Sentence Embedding to refer sentences in the form of a vector of real numbers which encodes meaningful 
semantic information. And at last applied Inverse document frequency method to identify the keywords which holds the special importance and can be used in various areas such as focusing on key insights
and recommendations or marketing purpose.
