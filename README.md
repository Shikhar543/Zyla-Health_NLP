Business Problem Statement:
Context:
Zyla Health, a digital health platform, aims to improve its search engine visibility (SEO) and enhance customer understanding through advanced analysis of user reviews and feedback collected via the Google Play Store. Currently, the company struggles to identify which aspects of the app are most appreciated, which cause dissatisfaction, and which keywords or phrases can drive more meaningful engagement online.
Despite receiving a large volume of customer reviews and ratings, Zyla Health lacks a structured, data-driven approach to extract actionable insights from this unstructured feedback. This leads to missed opportunities in SEO improvement, customer sentiment understanding, feature prioritization, and content optimization.

Objective:
To leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and feedback, and:
Identify key themes and topics through topic modeling.
Extract high-value keywords using Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for SEO and marketing content.
Use sentence embedding to understand the context of user reviews and queries.
Generate insights to improve app features, user satisfaction, and customer support strategies.

Key Process :-


Welcome to this NLP Project for Zyla Health Company .
Data Scraping :- I have scraped all the necessary details like reviews, ratings etc. from Google Play Store and performed Data Cleaning , Data Processing and essential Natural Language 
Processing methods such as Topic Modeling to remove unnecessary emojis and punctuations and whitespaces, Sentence Embedding to refer sentences in the form of a vector of real numbers which encodes meaningful 
semantic information. And at last applied Inverse document frequency method to identify the keywords which holds the special importance and can be used in various areas such as focusing on key insights
and recommendations or marketing purpose.

Libraries used :- 

1].Beautifulsoup for Data Scraping ,
2].pandas , numpy , seaborn , matplotlib for Data Preprocessing
3].TfidfVectorizer , pylDavis , Wordcloud , nltk for Topic Modelling Process
4].sentence transformer , tensorflow for Sentence Embedding technique
5].spacy, typing-extensions for Inverse Document Frequency.

Conclusion :- The IDF can help to identify the right keywords which is essential for improving search engine optimization (SEO) and creating content that resonates with the target audience. IDF can improve a chatbot's ability to understand the context of a userâ€™s query by identifying the key terms. If a user query contains common words, IDF downweights them, while it highlights rare, meaningful terms for better understanding.
