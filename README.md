Zyla Health wants to improve Search Engine results and wants to analyze customer reviews and feedbacks using their app.

Key Process :-


Welcome to this NLP Project for Zyla Health Company .
Data Scraping :- I have scraped all the necessary details like reviews, ratings etc. from Google Play Store and performed Data Cleaning , Data Processing and essential Natural Language 
Processing methods such as Topic Modeling to remove unnecessary emojis and punctuations and whitespaces, Sentence Embedding to refer sentences in the form of a vector of real numbers which encodes meaningful 
semantic information. And at last applied Inverse document frequency method to identify the keywords which holds the special importance and can be used in various areas such as focusing on key insights
and recommendations or marketing purpose.

Libraries used :- 

1].Beautifulsoup for Data Scraping ,
2].pandas , numpy , seaborn , matplotlib for Data Preprocessing
3].TfidfVectorizer , pylDavis , Wordcloud , nltk for Topic Modelling Process
4].sentence transformer , tensorflow for Sentence Embedding technique
5].spacy, typing-extensions for Inverse Document Frequency.

Conclusion :- The IDF can help to identify the right keywords which is essential for improving search engine optimization (SEO) and creating content that resonates with the target audience. IDF can improve a chatbot's ability to understand the context of a userâ€™s query by identifying the key terms. If a user query contains common words, IDF downweights them, while it highlights rare, meaningful terms for better understanding.
